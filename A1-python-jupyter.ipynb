    "  The counter class is used for getting the frequency of occurrence. In this notebook it was used to get the frequency of occurrence of the tokens across the whole corpus, that is how many times a particular token occured in the entire corpus. It was also used to count in how many document a particular word occurs.\n",

    "- What is text normalization?<br>\n",
    "  Text normalization is the process of replacing tokens with their canonical form. This helps us group together different forms, spellings or variations of the same word. Some examples are Stemming, Lemmatization, American-to-British mapping and Synonym mapping.\n",
